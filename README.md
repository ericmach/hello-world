This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.
My name is Eric Mach and I am a graduate of Northeastern University, class of 2022. I received my B.S. in Bioengineering with a minor in Mathematics, as well as an M.S. in Engineering Management. I chose to pursue the BU OMDS program as part of a career change into a more data-centric role.
